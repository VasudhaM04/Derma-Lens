## 1. Project Title

**DermaLens: A Fairness-Aware, Explainable Smartphone Application for Early Skin Cancer Risk Assessment**

---

## 2. Abstract

Skin cancer, particularly melanoma, has high mortality when detected late, and access to timely dermatological screening is limited in many regions. This project proposes DermaLens, a smartphone-based application that performs on-device, AI-driven risk assessment of skin lesions using only the phone camera. A lightweight MobileNetV3-based convolutional neural network is optimized and quantized for real-time inference on consumer devices, enabling fully offline, privacy-preserving analysis. The model is trained on publicly available dermoscopic and smartphone-captured datasets, with a fairness-aware training strategy that explicitly reduces performance gaps across different skin tones. The app guides users to capture high-quality images, generates risk categories (low/medium/high), and provides GradCAM-based visual explanations to increase transparency and user trust. Longitudinal tracking allows users to monitor lesion evolution over time, while exportable reports support clinician consultation and triage. By combining computer vision, mobile deployment, explainability, and fairness, DermaLens aims to deliver a practical, low-cost decision-support tool that can improve early detection, reduce inequalities in access to screening, and provide a strong foundation for future clinical validation and research.

## 3. Problem Statement

Early detection of melanoma remains critical for improving survival rates, yet access to dermatological screening is severely limited by:
- Geographic barriers and uneven distribution of specialists
- Long wait times for dermatology appointments (average 3-6 months in many regions)
- High costs of specialist consultations
- Limited healthcare infrastructure in low and middle-income countries (LMICs)

Current commercial smartphone apps for skin cancer screening suffer from significant limitations:
1. **High false positive rates (over-detection)**: Leading to unnecessary specialist visits and healthcare system burden
2. **Poor performance across diverse skin tones**: Accuracy drops of 15-20% on darker skin (Fitzpatrick IV-VI) due to training data bias
3. **Lack of explainability**: Black-box predictions erode user and clinician trust
4. **Limited real-world validation**: Most studies use dermoscopic images, not smartphone photos
5. **Privacy concerns**: Many apps require cloud connectivity and data upload

These issues result in overburdened healthcare systems, reduced user adoption despite high download rates (900k+ for leading apps), and perpetuation of health inequities.

## 4. Research Gap

Existing smartphone skin cancer detection systems demonstrate proof-of-concept but fall short in critical areas:

| **Gap Area** | **Current State** | **DermaLens Innovation** |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| **Fairness** | 15-20% accuracy drop on darker skin tones | <5% gap through fairness-aware training |
| **False Positives** | 49% of benign lesions flagged as high-risk | 25% reduction via confidence calibration |
| **Explainability** | No visual reasoning provided | Real-time GradCAM++ heatmaps |
| **Validation** | Dermoscopic images, limited user studies | Smartphone photos + 100-user validation |
| **Privacy** | Cloud-dependent, data upload required | Fully offline, on-device inference |
| **Tracking** | Single-point assessment only | Longitudinal monitoring with change alerts |

**Key Research Question:** Can a fairness-optimized, explainable CNN deployed on consumer smartphones achieve >92% accuracy with <5% performance gap across skin tones while maintaining user trust and clinical utility?

## 8. Fairness Methodology

DermaLens achieves fairness through a multi-stage approach addressing both data and algorithmic bias:

### 8.1 Skin-Tone-Robust Image Preprocessing

**Goal:** Standardize lesion features while preserving diagnostic information across all skin tones.

**Techniques:**
1. **Hair Removal:** Black Top-Hat morphological transform removes hair artifacts that vary by ethnicity
2. **Lesion-Focused Cropping:** Auto-detect and crop lesion region, minimizing background skin exposure
3. **Adaptive Color Normalization:**
   - CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) applied per-channel
   - Standardizes lesion-skin contrast regardless of absolute skin darkness
4. **Relative Color Features:** Focus on lesion vs surrounding skin color differences, not absolute RGB values
5. **Tone-Balanced Augmentation:**
   - Color jitter simulating Fitzpatrick I-VI range
   - Brightness/contrast augmentation
   - Style transfer-inspired skin tone diversification

### 8.2 Skin Tone Detection as Control Signal

**Fitzpatrick Classifier (Auxiliary Head):**
- Predicts approximate skin tone category (I-VI) from background skin
- Used during training for fairness monitoring
- NOT used to change inference thresholds (maintains single global decision rule)

**Purpose:**
- Monitor per-group accuracy during training
- Drive fairness loss computation
- Enable stratified evaluation

### 8.3 Fairness-Aware Training Objective

**Multi-Task Loss Function:**
```
L_total = α × L_risk + β × L_fitzpatrick + γ × L_fairness

Where:
- L_risk = Cross-Entropy(predicted_risk, true_label)
- L_fitzpatrick = Cross-Entropy(predicted_tone, estimated_tone)
- L_fairness = max(Acc_i) - min(Acc_i) for i ∈ [Fitz I-VI]

Hyperparameters: α=1.0, β=0.15, γ=0.25
```

**Fairness Loss Explanation:**
- Computes sensitivity/specificity per skin tone group in each mini-batch
- Penalizes large performance gaps between groups
- Forces model to find features that work universally

**Training Strategy:**
- Distribution-aware reweighting: Over-sample underrepresented skin tones
- Prune learning: Remove neurons that activate primarily for specific tones
- Adversarial training: Prevent model from inferring skin tone from internal features

### 8.4 Color-Invariant Feature Learning

**Architectural Design Choices:**
1. **Multi-Scale Feature Fusion:** Capture both fine texture and global structure
2. **Edge-Aware Augmentation:** EdgeMixup-style perturbations emphasize borders over color
3. **Attention Mechanisms:**
   - Channel attention (SE blocks): Focus on discriminative feature channels
   - Spatial attention: Highlight lesion regions vs background
   - Skin-tone attention: Adaptive feature weighting based on estimated tone

**Result:** Similar internal representations for structurally similar lesions regardless of skin darkness.

### 8.5 Fairness Evaluation Metrics

**Test Set Stratification:**
- Continuous skin tone score (ITA° - Individual Typology Angle)
- Grouped by Fitzpatrick type (I-II, III-IV, V-VI)

**Reported Metrics Per Group:**
- Sensitivity (True Positive Rate)
- Specificity (True Negative Rate)
- F1 Score
- AUC-ROC
- False Positive Rate

**Fairness Metrics:**
- **Equalized Odds Gap:** max|Sens_i - Sens_j| across groups
- **Performance Parity:** Standard deviation of accuracy across groups
- **Demographic Parity:** Difference in positive prediction rates

**DermaLens Target:** <5% gap in sensitivity/specificity across all skin tone groups

## 14. Risk Mitigation & Limitations

### 14.1 Technical Risks

**Risk:** Model overfits to dermoscopic images, poor smartphone performance  
**Mitigation:** Train on PAD-UFES smartphone dataset, domain adaptation, extensive augmentation

**Risk:** Quantization degrades accuracy significantly  
**Mitigation:** Quantization-aware training, gradual pruning, mixed precision

**Risk:** High false positive rate frustrates users  
**Mitigation:** Confidence calibration, uncertainty estimation, user education

**Risk:** Poor image quality from diverse cameras  
**Mitigation:** Quality checks, AR guides, multi-shot capture, rejection thresholds

### 14.2 Ethical & Clinical Risks

**Risk:** Users rely on app instead of seeing doctors  
**Mitigation:** Clear disclaimers, "not a diagnosis" messaging, recommend consultation for high-risk

**Risk:** Algorithmic bias despite fairness efforts  
**Mitigation:** Rigorous evaluation, transparent reporting, continuous monitoring

**Risk:** Privacy concerns with image storage  
**Mitigation:** On-device processing, encrypted local storage, no cloud uploads

**Risk:** Unlicensed medical advice regulations  
**Mitigation:** Position as "decision support tool," not diagnostic device, consult regulatory experts

### 14.3 Project Limitations

**Scope Limitations:**
- Not a replacement for dermatologist examination
- No support for non-pigmented skin cancers (basal cell, squamous cell)
- Limited to visible lesions (no internal organ screening)
- Requires clear photos (not suitable for all body locations)

**Dataset Limitations:**
- Training data may not represent all global populations
- Limited examples of rare skin conditions
- Dermoscopic images differ from smartphone photos

**Validation Limitations:**
- User study with convenience sample (not clinical trial)
- No long-term follow-up data
- No comparison with dermatologist diagnosis in study

**Technical Limitations:**
- Performance depends on smartphone camera quality
- Older devices may have slower inference
- Requires sufficient storage space
